# Hello
- This is a snake game that my team made when learning an AI course at HCMUTE, VietNam.

- I call it stupid because it still has a lot to work on. When the snake's length is kind of large, it just gives up on life...

- this program was code in Python, pygame (2.6.1)
## Preview
- The player's screen is straightforward.
- The AI screen is not clean code. Just press Reset, Pause, or Back when the snake eats, and you will be fine, maybeâ€¦

- Using BFS, DFS, UCS, GREEDY, A* search algorithms.
